## 0. The gap (precisely)

After A2 the §4.C chain is:

```
committed A/B  ──A2 strip-opening──▶  plain tile strips ∈ HASH_A
                                              │   (§4.C.2 — THIS)
                                              ▼
swept a′/b′  ──M-S1 LogUp multiset──▶  declared noised_packed store
```

M-S1 binds *sweep ⊆ store*; A2 binds *plain strips ∈ committed
`HASH_A`*. **Nothing yet forces `store == noise(plain
strips)`.** A malicious prover may declare *any* noised store
(M-S1 only ties the sweep to whatever store it declares) — so
the swept matmul need not be over the committed matrix. §4.C.2
closes this: every store entry must be
`A_committed + E` with `E` the Pearl low-rank noise derived from
the C1-pinned seed `s_a` (resp. `B + F` from `s_b`).

Soundness today without §4.C.2: held by CRIT-1 + §4.D keystone +
§6(a) + §6(b) + M-S1 (not a *forgery* hole — the swept work is
pinned to *a* declared store and the fold/digest chain is
forced); §4.C.2 upgrades "fold of *a declared* matmul" → "fold
of *the committed block's* matmul" — full §4.C soundness, zero
gap.

## 1. The exact relation to enforce (verified against the code)

`crates/ai-pow/src/matmul.rs` + `prng.rs` (the byte-equivalent
Pearl reference):

```
a_prime[i,l] = A[i,l] + E[i,l]
E[i,l]       = E_L[i, pp_l] − E_L[i, pm_l]
  E_L[i,·]   = expand_e_l_row(s_a, i, r)       // r × uniform 6-bit, BLAKE3(s_a)-keyed
  (pp_l,pm_l)= e_r_col_positions(s_a, l, r)    // per-COLUMN pair, BLAKE3(s_a)-keyed,
                                               //   distinct, ∈ [0,r)
b_prime[l,j] = B[l,j] + F[l,j]                 // B col-major
F[l,j]       = F_R[j, pp_l] − F_R[j, pm_l]
  F_R[j,·]   = expand_f_r_col(s_b, j, r)
  (pp_l,pm_l)= f_l_row_positions(s_b, l, r)    // BLAKE3(s_b)-keyed
```

Key simplification (why this is tractable, not a generic
`r`-wide matmul): `E_R` is a **signed 2-sparse selection**
(exactly one `+1` and one `−1` per column) ⇒ `E[i,l]` is just a
**difference of two `E_L` entries** of row `i`. The per-element
noise needs: (a) the `r`-wide `E_L` row for the strip's matrix
row, (b) the two column-positions `(pp_l,pm_l)`, (c) a
select-and-subtract. Both (a) and (b) are BLAKE3-keyed PRNG
expansions of the **C1-pinned** `s_a`/`s_b`.

## 2. The lever already in place

`chips/input.rs` **already** enforces, per row:

```
NOISED_PACKED[c] == polyval(MAT_UNPACK[4c..],256) + polyval(NOISE_UNPACK[4c..],256)
```

So if, on the M-S1 store rows, we set
**`MAT_UNPACK = the committed plain strip bytes`** and
**`NOISE_UNPACK = E` (the Pearl noise bytes)**, then
`NOISED_PACKED == plain + E == a_prime` *for free* (existing
InputChip constraint). §4.C.2 then needs only **two** new
bindings:

- **B1 — `MAT_UNPACK` ↔ committed plain strip.** The store
  row's `MAT_UNPACK` must equal the bytes the A2 strip-opening
  leaf layer hashed (which are ∈ `HASH_A`). This is the
  **existing C3 pattern** (`IS_MSG_MAT·(BLAKE3_MSG[j] −
  base256(UINT8_DATA))=0`): make the strip-opening *leaf* rows
  carry the plain bytes as `BLAKE3_MSG` *and* be the store
  rows (`IS_MSG_MAT=1`, `MAT_UNPACK=plain`). C3 already binds
  hashed-bytes ↔ `UINT8_DATA`/`MAT_UNPACK`; reuse it. (M52's C3
  is exactly this mechanism on the full-matrix path; A2 made
  the leaf layer the *strip* path — B1 is wiring the store onto
  those leaf rows.)
- **B2 — `NOISE_UNPACK` ↔ `E` derived from `s_a`.** The new
  **noise-derivation sub-AIR**: from the C1-pinned `s_a`,
  expand `E_L[i,·]` and `(pp_l,pm_l)`, compute
  `NOISE_UNPACK[·] = E_L[i,pp_l] − E_L[i,pm_l]`. This is the
  hard, genuinely new part.

## 3′. CORRECTED design — Pearl §4.7 preprocessed noise (no sub-AIR)

The InputChip (`chips/input.rs::eval`, every row, unconditional):

```
(1) NOISE_PACKED_PREP == polyval(NOISE_UNPACK[0..8], base=129)
(2) NOISED_PACKED[i]  == polyval(MAT_UNPACK[4i..],256)
                       + polyval(NOISE_UNPACK[4i..],256)        i∈{0,1}
```

`NOISE_PACKED_PREP` ∈ the 5 CRIT-1 PROGRAM_COLS — the verifier
rebuilds it witness-free from the trusted shape
(`composite_preprocess::fill_preprocessed_row` ←
`RowDescriptor.noise_packed`). (1) ⇒ `NOISE_UNPACK` is *forced*
to the verifier-pinned noise (polyval-129 is injective over the
range-checked i7 bytes). So:

**§4.C.2 = three wirings, all on existing mechanisms:**

- **W1 (verifier-pinned noise).** The canonical-program
  reconstruction sets, for each M-S1 store row, `noise_packed =
  polyval(noise_chunk,129)` where `noise_chunk` is the Pearl
  noise for that chunk's matrix positions, computed by the
  verifier via **`noise_ref`** (A3.0, proven byte-equivalent to
  `BlockNoise`; a pure public fn of the C1-pinned `s_a`/`s_b` +
  params). InputChip (1) then forces the prover's
  `NOISE_UNPACK` to equal it.
- **W2 (store decomposition).** M-S1 store rows change from
  `MAT_UNPACK=a′, NOISE_UNPACK=0` to `MAT_UNPACK=committed
  plain, NOISE_UNPACK=pinned noise`. InputChip (2) then makes
  `NOISED_PACKED = plain + noise = a′` — **the same
  `NOISED_PACKED` value as today**, so M-S1's
  `enumerate_noised_chunks`/`MAT_FREQ` LogUp still balances
  (only the MAT/NOISE split changes, not the packed value).
- **W3 = B1 (plain ↔ HASH_A).** Bind `MAT_UNPACK` (now the
  plain bytes) to the A2 strip-opening leaf bytes via the
  **existing C3** `IS_MSG_MAT·(BLAKE3_MSG[j] −
  base256(UINT8_DATA))=0` (the M52 mechanism) — make the
  store rows the strip-opening leaf rows (`IS_MSG_MAT=1`,
  `MAT_UNPACK=plain`).

Net chain (all forced in-circuit, zero gap): committed A/B
─C3/strip-opening(A2)→ plain ─InputChip(2)→ `NOISED_PACKED =
plain + noise` ; noise ─InputChip(1)→ `NOISE_PACKED_PREP`
─CRIT-1 pin← verifier `noise_ref(s_a)` ─C1← `s_a` ; M-S1 ⇒
sweep ⊆ store(`NOISED_PACKED`). ⇒ the swept matmul is provably
over `noise(committed A,B)`.

**Staged landing (corrected, KAT-first):**
- **A3.0 ✅** `noise_ref` + cross-crate KAT (done, `4c6b3e8`).
- **A3.1 ✅** prover-side per-store-row `(plain,noise)` map +
  cross-crate KAT (`enumerate_noised_chunks_with_src`,
  `NoisedChunkSrc`; every store chunk == committed_plain +
  `noise_ref` byte-for-byte; `79f748d`). No AIR change.
- **A3.2a (next) — position-addressed store schedule.** Replace
  M-S1's value-deduped `enumerate_noised_chunks` store layout
  with a params/tile-deterministic one so the verifier can
  recompute row→`(tile,lane,l)` (and thus `NOISE_PACKED_PREP`)
  witness-free. Must keep M-S1's LogUp balance
  (`NOISED_PACKED` multiset unchanged) and re-validate Route-A.
- **A3.2b ✅ DONE 2026-05-17 (b1).** `write_noised_row_split` +
  `place_noised_store_row_split`; bridge places the store via
  the A3.1 `enumerate_noised_chunks_with_src` decomposition
  (`MAT_UNPACK=ctx.a/b plain`, `NOISE_UNPACK=noise_ref(s_a/s_b)`,
  `NOISE_PACKED_PREP=polyval(noise,129)`). `a′=plain+noise` fits
  i8 no-wrap ⇒ `NOISED_PACKED` unchanged ⇒ M-S1 LogUp balanced.
  InputChip eqn1 + the CRIT-1 `NOISE_PACKED_PREP` pin ⇒ **the
  store noise is forced to Pearl `noise_ref` of the C1-public
  seed — the prover cannot choose it**. MED-3 bridge roundtrip
  green through the full split-store path; §4.C.2 decomposition
  KAT green. **The §4.C.2 *noise* tie is closed.**
- **A3.2c = W3/B1 — the remaining §4.C.2 piece (the *plain*
  tie); not yet implemented.** Two forms, different
  soundness/cost (FINDING 2026-05-17):
  - **(c-exact) — co-location (position-exact, zero-gap).** Make
    the store rows *be* the strip-opening leaf compression rows
    so the existing C3 (`IS_MSG_MAT·IS_NEW_BLAKE·(BLAKE3_MSG[j]−
    base256(UINT8_DATA))`) binds `MAT_UNPACK` to the exact
    committed plain bytes that leaf hashed into `HASH_A`.
    Requires aligning the 8-i8 store window to a leaf
    compression's 64-byte `BLAKE3_MSG` across the
    1024-B-chunk ↔ 8-i8-window granularity gap — **the
    M-S1-magnitude core difficulty §4.C.2 has always been
    flagged for.** This is the zero-gap target.
  - **(c-mset) — LogUp multiset (tractable, structurally
    weaker).** A new bus: strip-opening leaves *publish* the
    committed plain byte-windows; store rows *query* their
    `MAT_UNPACK` ⊆ that multiset (mirrors M-S1's own pattern).
    Far more tractable (well-trodden in this codebase) but
    binds *membership*, not *position*: with the A3.2b
    position-pinned noise it yields "every swept `a′` = (some
    committed plain window) + (the position's Pearl noise)" —
    strictly stronger than today, but **not plain-side
    position-exact** (a documented residual vs "zero gap").
  Per R1, (c-exact) is the correct end state and is **not to
  be rushed**; (c-mset) is a legitimate validated *interim*
  with a precise residual if needed. The decision (c-exact now
  vs c-mset-interim→c-exact) is surfaced to the maintainer.
- **A3.2c (B1 plain tie) — c-mset interim, staged (maintainer
  hybrid decision; ≈M-S1-magnitude new LogUp bus ⇒ R1 staged,
  not rushed):**
  - **c-mset.0 ✅** off-circuit/KAT de-risk (the M-S1 coverage-net
    / P-B.2.0 discipline): against the real bridge geometry,
    every store `MAT_UNPACK` window's *real bytes* == committed
    plain at contiguous positions inside the hashed span
    (`5436f89`). Necessary but — as c-mset.1a showed — **not
    sufficient** for a balancing bus (it `continue`d past
    zero-pad).
  - **c-mset.1a ✅ DONE 2026-05-17 (`2c2d7c6`)** — KAT-first
    de-risk at the **exact `BUS_PLAIN` AIR key** (no AIR change;
    the P-B.2.0/c-mset.0 discipline carried one level deeper):
    - **Producer** = strip-opening leaf-chunk **round-0
      (`IS_NEW_BLAKE`)** rows' *unpermuted* `BLAKE3_MSG` (16
      u32-LE words = the 64 committed bytes of each hashed
      block; rows 1..7/finalize hold the *permuted* schedule —
      must NOT be read), split into the 8 disjoint word-pair
      windows `(BLAKE3_MSG[2j], BLAKE3_MSG[2j+1])`, j∈0..8,
      over the opened strip `[c0,c1)` only.
    - **Consumer** = store-row plain `MAT_UNPACK` window, packed
      identically (u32-LE of `UINT8_DATA` = `polyval(.,256)` per
      4 bytes).
    - **Validated FINDING:** `consumer ⊆ producer` (the exact
      LogUp balance premise) holds **iff `16 | r`** — then every
      store window is 8 *dense* contiguous committed bytes,
      8-aligned in the row/col-major matrix, == one producer
      word-pair. Pearl §4.8 pins `r ∈ {2⁵..2¹⁰}` (every value a
      multiple of 16) ⇒ **production is always clean**;
      `TEST_SMALL` (`r=4`) is **not** (zero-pad tail, no
      committed counterpart — proven by the test's negative
      assertion). POSITIVE validated on `r=16` (single-chunk)
      **and** `r=32` (multi-chunk) §6(b)-live single-STARK
      geometries.
  - **c-mset.1b (next; residual)** add `BUS_PLAIN` const +
    `PLAIN_FREQ` column + `push_interaction`: producer on the
    strip-opening leaf-chunk round-0 rows; consumer on store
    rows. **Emission `16|r`-gated** (params-derived, the
    existing PROD-gating discipline — Pearl is always `16|r`;
    `TEST_SMALL` r=4 stays inert so its Route-A tests are
    untouched). **OPEN MAINTAINER DECISION (soundness-AIR
    shape):** the producer must fire *only* on matrix-leaf-chunk
    round-0 rows, never on parent compressions (message =
    `left‖right` CVs, not committed bytes) or C2/C4/jackpot
    BLAKE3. No existing selector isolates this. Options, both
    invasive to the **CRIT-1-pinned program**: (i) a dedicated
    selector set by `place_leaf_chunk` on leaf round-0 rows
    (new `SELECTOR_COL` ⇒ width/preprocessed/CRIT-1-rebuild/all
    layout-assert/all Route-A-baseline ripple); (ii) decode the
    BLAKE3 tweak flags (`F_CHUNK_START & F_KEYED_HASH &
    !F_PARENT`) from the packed `CV_OR_TWEAK_PREP` in-AIR (no
    width change; adds tweak-decode constraint logic to the
    pinned program). Decision required before the AIR change.
  - **c-mset.2** `populate_lookup_freq` accounting for the new
    bus (producer `PLAIN_FREQ`); honest balance.
  - **c-mset.3** Route-A on a **`16|r` §6(b)-live single-STARK
    geometry** (`P16 = {m:16,k:64,n:16,noise_rank:16,tile:8}` —
    c-mset.1a-confirmed §6(b)-live & single-STARK; **NOT**
    `TEST_SMALL`) + debug-assertions-ON + adversarial (a store
    `MAT_UNPACK` ∉ the committed-plain multiset rejects); full
    `ai-pow-zk --lib` + `ai-pow --features zk`. (The
    LogUp-coupling / unit≠Route-A hazard — M-S1 lesson — gates
    every sub-step.)
  After c-mset: §4.C.2 = "every swept `a′` = (some committed
  plain window) + (the store row's position-pinned Pearl
  noise)" — strictly stronger than pre-A3, **not a forgery
  hole**; plain-side position-exactness is the **precise
  documented residual** (c-exact).
- **A3.2c (B1) — c-exact (zero-gap completion; the Phase-A3
  residual after c-mset).** Co-locate store rows onto the
  strip-opening leaf compression rows so the existing C3 binds
  `MAT_UNPACK` to the *exact* committed plain bytes ∈ `HASH_A`
  (the 1024-B-chunk ↔ 8-i8-window granularity bridge — the
  long-flagged §4.C.2 core difficulty). Its own staged effort
  (R1); closes the c-mset residual ⇒ true zero-gap §4.C.2.
- **A3.3** final gate: full `ai-pow-zk --lib` + `ai-pow
  --features zk` + debug-assertions-ON; §4.C end-to-end
  (committed → noise → store → M-S1 sweep → fold → digest);
  docs/`ZKP_SECURITY_REPORT`/`GAP_AUDIT` flip.

Far lighter than the struck-through §3 (no BLAKE3-keyed PRNG
sub-AIR, no select-subtract chip, no new LogUp): it is
*wiring + verifier-side noise reconstruction*, reusing CRIT-1 /
InputChip / C3. Still soundness-critical & invasive (CRIT-1
program reconstruction is the PoW-soundness linchpin) ⇒ staged
with Route-A + debug-assertions-ON at each step.

## 3. ~~B2 — the noise-derivation sub-AIR~~ (SUPERSEDED by §3′)

> Struck through — the in-circuit PRNG sub-AIR is **not**
> needed (Pearl §4.7 uses preprocessed noise; see §3′). Kept
> for the rationale of why the relation has the
> select-subtract form.

### ~~B2~~ (the milestone core)

Mirror, in-circuit, `prng.rs`'s `pearl_random_hash` /
`fill_uniform_row` / `pearl_permutation_pair`:

- **PRNG = BLAKE3-keyed.** `expand_e_l_row` and the position
  pair are BLAKE3 hashes keyed by `s_a` over a small message
  (chunk/slot index). ai-pow-zk **already has the in-circuit
  BLAKE3 chip** (`place_blake3_hash_*`) and C1 pins `s_a`
  (`COMMITMENT_HASH`). So E_L / positions are BLAKE3 outputs of
  `s_a` + a public counter — placeable as ordinary BLAKE3
  compression blocks whose key is the C1-pinned `s_a`.
- **`E_L` row:** `r` × 6-bit uniform = a deterministic slice of
  the BLAKE3 keystream (`fill_uniform_row`'s exact byte→i7 map).
- **Positions `(pp_l,pm_l)`:** `pearl_permutation_pair`'s
  `first = rnd & (r−1); second = first ^ (1 + mul_hi(r−1,rnd))`
  — a few field ops on a BLAKE3 word; `r` is a pinned power of
  two (§4.8/P-A) so `r−1` is a constant mask.
- **Select + subtract:** `E[i,l] = E_L[i,pp_l] − E_L[i,pm_l]`.
  `pp_l/pm_l ∈ [0,r)`; selection via a pinned/derived one-hot
  over the `r` `E_L` lanes (degree-2, the §6(b) one-hot
  pattern), then a subtraction. `r ≤ 1024` (§4.8) bounds the
  one-hot width.

This is bounded (no generic `r`-matmul), but it is a new
multi-row sub-AIR + LogUp/range plumbing + the C1-`s_a` key
binding ⇒ **milestone-scale**.

## 4. Staged landing (KAT-first — the P-B.2.0 discipline)

- **A3.0 — off-circuit noise reference + KAT (no circuit
  change).** A pure `noise_ref` module reproducing
  `E[i,l]`/`F[l,j]` from `s_a`/`s_b` and **bit-identical to
  `ai-pow::matmul::BlockNoise`** over many shapes (the
  cross-crate equivalence; ai-pow-zk must not dep ai-pow, so
  re-derive from the same BLAKE3 primitive and KAT the values
  passed across the bridge). De-risks the spec before any AIR.
- **A3.1 — `E_L`/position expansion in-circuit** from the
  C1-pinned `s_a` (BLAKE3 blocks + the byte→i7 map +
  permutation-pair ops); unit + KAT vs A3.0.
- **A3.2 — select-subtract + the InputChip wiring**: store rows
  get `MAT_UNPACK=plain`, `NOISE_UNPACK=E`; the existing
  InputChip closes `NOISED_PACKED=plain+E`. B1 (reuse C3) binds
  `MAT_UNPACK`↔strip-opening leaf bytes.
- **A3.3 — Route-A + adversarial**: a store whose `NOISE_UNPACK
  ≠ E(s_a)` (or `MAT_UNPACK ≠` committed strip) must reject;
  full `ai-pow-zk --lib` + `ai-pow --features zk`;
  debug-assertions-ON; the §4.C chain end-to-end (committed →
  noise → store → M-S1 sweep → fold → digest), zero gap.

Each stage: commit with the trailer; Route-A +
debug-assertions-ON; `Plonky3-recursion/` untracked.

## 5. Risks

- **Largest remaining soundness milestone** — invasive
  (touches the store rows, InputChip wiring, a new BLAKE3-keyed
  sub-AIR, C1-`s_a` binding, LogUp coupling — the M-S1 lesson:
  unit-AIR green ≠ Route-A green). Stage strictly; KAT-first.
- **Byte-equivalence to Pearl's PRNG** is the correctness
  anchor — A3.0's KAT vs `ai-pow::BlockNoise` (itself written
  Pearl-byte-equivalent) is the gate; ideally also vs Pearl
  reference vectors (Phase B1).
- B1 reuses C3 (proven), so the plain side is low-risk; B2 is
  where the effort/risk concentrates.

## 6. Cross-references

- Noise reference (mirror exactly): `ai-pow::matmul`
  (`BlockNoise::expand`, `e_row_into`/`f_col_into`),
  `ai-pow::prng` (`expand_e_l_row`, `e_r_col_positions`,
  `pearl_permutation_pair`, `fill_uniform_row`).
- Lever: `ai-pow-zk::chips::input` (the `NOISED_PACKED =
  polyval(MAT_UNPACK)+polyval(NOISE_UNPACK)` constraint).
- C3 pattern to reuse for B1: the `IS_MSG_MAT·(BLAKE3_MSG −
  base256(UINT8_DATA))` binding (`composite_full_air`).
- M-S1 store: `composite_trace::place_noised_store_row` /
  `enumerate_noised_chunks`.
- Roadmap: `PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md` Phase A3; `HIGH2_2_DESIGN.md`
  §7 / §4.C.11.

## 8. Maintainer decision 2026-05-17 — **skip c-mset → c-exact** (comparison + c-exact design + staged plan)

After **c-mset.1a** (`2c2d7c6`) the c-mset path required a fork
(the producer-row-isolation mechanism — a CRIT-1-pinned-program
shape decision). Surfaced to the maintainer; **decision:
ABANDON the c-mset `BUS_PLAIN` bus; pursue c-exact**
(position-exact, zero-gap), with this comparison produced first.

> **c-mset.0 / c-mset.1a are NOT discarded.** They are retained
> as the KAT-first de-risk that (a) *justified* this decision
> (c-mset.1a proved the bus needs invasive CRIT-1-program gating
> *and* only honest-balances `16|r`), and (b) establishes facts
> **c-exact directly reuses**: every store window is a
> *contiguous* committed sub-run inside the hashed span
> (c-mset.0) that is *8-aligned == one leaf word-pair* under
> production `16|r` (c-mset.1a). This is the P-B.2.0/D1 pattern:
> exhaustive KATs surfacing the true cost/shape *before*
> invasive AIR work.

### 8.1 c-mset vs c-exact — effort / soundness

| Axis | c-mset (LogUp membership bus) | **c-exact (co-location via C3)** |
|---|---|---|
| Soundness | swept `a′` ∈ {committed windows} + pinned noise — *membership* | swept `a′` = committed byte at the *exact* strip position + noise — *position-exact* |
| Residual | plain-side position-exactness (documented gap) | **none** — true zero-gap §4.C.2 |
| New trace surface | new `BUS_PLAIN` + `PLAIN_FREQ` col + producer-row isolation | reuses the **existing, proven C3** binding; no new bus / FREQ col |
| CRIT-1 pinned-program impact | unavoidable (FREQ width **or** new selector **or** tweak-decode constraint) | C3 already exists; impact = a small CONTROL_PREP-pinned word-offset (the **proven §6(a) pattern, zero new columns**) |
| `16|r` geometry | bus only balances `16|r`; needs a new `P16` Route-A geometry | same `16|r` alignment is *exploited* (store window == leaf word-pair) — c-mset.1a's positive finding is **reused** |
| LogUp-coupling risk (M-S1 unit≠Route-A) | present (new bus + `populate_lookup_freq`) | **absent** — C3 is a per-row algebraic identity, no permutation argument |
| Effort | M-S1-magnitude (new bus arc) **+** the open decision | M-S1-magnitude (the granularity bridge) **−** LogUp/freq risk |

**Conclusion:** c-exact dominates — comparable effort,
*strictly stronger* (zero-gap) result, and it **removes** both
the LogUp-coupling risk class and the open producer-isolation
decision. c-mset's only edge (the well-trodden bus pattern) was
nullified by c-mset.1a showing the bus needs invasive
CRIT-1-program gating regardless. The decision is well-founded.

### 8.2 c-exact design — the 1024-B-chunk ↔ 8-i8-window bridge

**C3** (`IS_MSG_MAT·IS_NEW_BLAKE·(BLAKE3_MSG[j] −
base256(UINT8_DATA[4j..4j+4])) = 0`) binds, on a strip-opening
leaf-chunk **round-0** row, that row's `UINT8_DATA` to its
hashed `BLAKE3_MSG` — which is ∈ `HASH_A` via the strip-opening
tree + the CRIT-1-pinned `HASH_A` PI. Today `UINT8_DATA_LEN=8`
so C3 binds only the first **8** of a leaf block's **64**
hashed bytes (message words j=0,1). The store needs *every*
8-byte window bound to its **exact** committed leaf
sub-position. Mechanisms:

- **(E1 — RECOMMENDED) pinned per-row word-offset.** Keep
  `UINT8_DATA=8`. Co-locate each store row onto the leaf
  compression whose 64-byte block contains its window; add a
  CRIT-1-pinned per-row word-offset `o ∈ {0,2,…,14}` so C3
  binds `BLAKE3_MSG[o+j]` (not fixed j∈{0,1}). `o` is folded
  into `CONTROL_PREP` exactly like §6(a)'s fold-slot / G2's
  fold-stripe (**proven pattern, NO new column, no
  preprocessed-width ripple**); it is a pure function of the
  A3.2a position-addressed store layout (`noised_store_layout`)
  + the A1 `tile_chunk_range` schedule ⇒ verifier-recomputable
  witness-free (the CRIT-1 discipline already in place).
  Position-exact by construction; reuses the *proven* C3 +
  *proven* §6(a) pin; no bus, no FREQ, no permutation.
- **(E2) widen C3 to 64.** `UINT8_DATA` 8→64, C3 over all 16
  words. One leaf row binds all 64 bytes; heavier width ripple
  than E1.
- **(E3) generic store↔leaf LogUp.** Re-introduces a
  permutation argument — the risk class being moved away from.
  Rejected.

### 8.3 Staged KAT-first plan (R1; the next concrete step is cx.0)

- **cx.0** (KAT-first de-risk; **no AIR change**) — pure Rust on
  a `16|r` geometry: every A3.2a position-addressed store row
  maps to a **unique `(chunk, block-in-chunk, word-offset)`** of
  the strip-opening, the committed bytes at that exact leaf
  sub-position == the store row's plain `MAT_UNPACK` == `a′ −
  noise_ref`, **and** `BLAKE3_MSG[o+j] == base256(committed
  window)` (the exact C3 identity). Extends c-mset.0/.1a from
  *contiguity/alignment* to the *exact (block,offset) address +
  C3 pack*. The gate before any AIR change.
- **cx.1** generalize C3 to the pinned word-offset
  (`pack_control_prep_full` + ControlChip assert +
  `extract_program` lift — the §6(a)/G2 mechanism); unit +
  adversarial (stale / forged / claimed-absent offset reject),
  debug-assertions-ON.
- **cx.2** co-locate store rows onto leaf compression rows
  (`place_matrix_strip_opening`/bridge): the store row *is* the
  leaf round-0 row with `IS_MSG_MAT=1`, `UINT8_DATA` = its
  committed window, `o` pinned from the deterministic schedule.
- **cx.3** Route-A on a `16|r` §6(b)-live single-STARK geometry
  (`P16={m:16,k:64,n:16,noise_rank:16,tile:8}`, c-mset.1a-
  confirmed; **not** `TEST_SMALL`) + adversarial (store window
  ≠ the committed leaf sub-block ⇒ C3 reject = the
  position-exact soundness statement) + debug-assertions-ON +
  full `ai-pow-zk --lib` + `ai-pow --features zk`.
- **A3.3** final gate; §4.C end-to-end; docs /
  `ZKP_SECURITY_REPORT` / `GAP_AUDIT` flip → §4.C.2 **zero-gap**.

Soundness meanwhile unchanged: CRIT-1 + §4.D + §6 + M-S1 + A2 +
the A3.2b noise pin hold; §4.C.2-with-A3.2b is already strictly
stronger than pre-A3 and **not a forgery hole**. c-exact is its
own staged effort (R1) — the next action is **cx.0 only**, not a
rushed AIR change.
