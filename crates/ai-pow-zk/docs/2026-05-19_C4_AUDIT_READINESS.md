# C4 / M-S6 — independent crypto audit: readiness package

> **Status (R1, honest).** This document is the **internal
> readiness package** for the C4/M-S6 milestone (`#125` —
> independent crypto audit of the ai-pow / ai-pow-zk soundness
> stack). C4 itself is, by construction, **external** — an audit
> report is produced by independent cryptographers consuming the
> shipped code + the artifacts indexed here. This doc therefore
> **does not** claim to perform the audit; it claims to make the
> audit *startable* by an external party with no prior context.
>
> What this delivers: (a) a threat model + audit scope, (b) the
> soundness-claim index (every claim → exact files / commits /
> tests that back it), (c) the recursion-stack inventory + AIR
> claims, (d) the KAT / adversarial-test catalogue, (e) the
> explicit known-residuals list (no hidden gaps), (f) an
> audit-readiness checklist with a small honest set of items
> still to ship before the audit begins.

> `2026-05-19_M_S5B_TERMINAL_COMPRESSION_DESIGN.md` (the

## 0. Purpose & how to use this document

An external auditor opening this repository for the first time
should be able to:

1. Read this doc § 1 + § 2 to fix **scope** and **threat model**.
2. Walk § 3's soundness-claim index, each row of which is a
   triple `(claim, where the claim is argued, where the claim
   is tested)`.
3. Use § 4–§ 6 as a map of the *substrate* (recursion stack +
   Tip5 AIR + the C3 outer cert) — the load-bearing crypto.
4. Use § 7 to find every adversarial / tamper-reject test
   already in tree, so the auditor can both reproduce and
   **add** tamper variants.
5. Read § 8 as the honest residuals list — nothing the audit
   should be surprised to discover later.
6. Use § 9–§ 10 to confirm the audit can begin (no missing
   artifacts).

The discipline is `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` **R1** — no fake
completion. If a claim has only a design argument and no test,
the index says so. If a test exists but is `#[ignore]`d, the
index says that and links the reason. If a residual is open,
it is listed in § 8, not omitted.

## 1. Audit scope

### 1.1 In-scope

The audit covers the **Nockchain SNARK soundness stack** for
mining the real shipped `Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-pearl` model
(see `2026-05-17_PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md` § 0):

| Component | Crate(s) | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Pearl-byte-equivalent mineable unit | `ai-pow` | the *plain* `TileState` / `keyed_hash` / `compute_tile_*` path the SNARK is *of*; byte-equiv to Pearl spec §4.1/§4.3 on type-0 INT GEMMs |
| ai-pow-zk soundness stack | `ai-pow-zk` | the Plonky3 STARK AIR + prover/verifier bridge proving the mineable unit |
| Recursion substrate | `Plonky3-recursion/` (vendored, excluded workspace) | C1: vendored Plonky3-recursion at the C1 fixed-point rev `c2c51fb` (rev-aligned to ai-pow-zk's `6de5cba`) |
| Tip5 circuit AIR | `Plonky3-recursion/tip5-circuit-air/` | C2: in-circuit Tip5 permutation, KAT-anchored to `nockchain-math::tip5::permute` |
| C3 / M-S5 outer-recursive cert | `Plonky3-recursion/recursion/tests/test_tip5_layer0_recursion.rs` + `test_tip5_layer0_compression.rs` | The ≥120-bit vertical-recursion certificate of the inner Tip5 Layer-0 proof |

### 1.2 Out-of-scope

- **Pearl-side code** (Pearl's vLLM plugin / `pearl/zk-pow`).
  We bind to Pearl byte-equivalence on the *mineable unit*; the
  Pearl SNARK pipeline is a separate (Plonky2-based) audit
  surface owned by Pearl.
- **FP8 PoUW.** Pearl §1.1 defers FP PoUW to an unshipped
  protocol. This audit covers INT (type-0) GEMMs only.
- **External integration (Phase D).** `D1` (vLLM miner-plugin
  extraction) and `D2 / M-C1` (consensus block-certificate
  integration) are external to ai-pow-zk and not in this audit.
- **M-S5b terminal compression (`#131`)** is **deferred** (see
  `2026-05-19_M_S5B_TERMINAL_COMPRESSION_DESIGN.md`). When it
  lands, a follow-on audit round covers the substrate addition.
  M-S5b is *not* hidden incompleteness of C3 — the ≤65 KB
  target was explicitly carved out and the C3 milestone is the
  soundness-correct ≥120-bit cert (LANDED).
- **G3 carry-vector segmentation.** Deferred (Pearl-faithful
  evaluation — this model is in-envelope; revive only if a
  workload exceeds `k ≤ 2¹⁶`). See
  `2026-05-17_M_S2_PEARL_EVALUATION.md`.
- **R-b**: ai-pow-zk's M10.1c composite `RecursiveAir` (vs the
  representative `FibonacciAir`) is **M12 / `#127`** — out of
  this audit.

### 1.3 What "soundness" means here

**2026-05-19 maintainer recalibration:** the per-block /
per-link soundness floor is **≥80 bits unconditional**,
anchored on the Johnson-radius proximity-gap bound *proven* by
Ben-Sasson, Carmon, Habock, Kopparty, Saraf, *"On Proximity
Gaps for Reed–Solomon Codes"* (`2025-2055.pdf`, Nov 2025,
Theorem 1.5 + §1.3.2). Rationale: per-block PoW that resets
every 2.5 min does not need the 120/128-bit margin that
defends long-horizon attacks; 80 unconditional bits in a 150 s
window requires ≈ 7 × 10²¹ hashes/sec of adversary work — far
past any feasible attacker. See
`2026-05-19_M_S5B_TERMINAL_COMPRESSION_DESIGN.md` §1.4 for
the full reasoning + per-path implications.

Two soundness objects, both **≥ 80 bits unconditional**:

1. **Per-block** (one mined tile). A prover that does not know
   a witness clearing the published difficulty cannot produce
   an accepting `(proof, public_inputs)` pair, except with
   probability ≤ 2⁻⁸⁰ over the verifier's randomness, in the
   *unconditional* Johnson-radius regime (no list-decoding
   conjecture).
2. **End-to-end recursion** (M-S5 cert). Every layer of the
   verifier-recursion chain is **≥ 80 bits unconditional** ⇒
   the compressed certificate's soundness floor is
   `min_i ≥ 80`. **Status:** the LANDED M-S5 chain
   (`lb=2, nq=120`) is comfortably ≥ 80 unconditional under
   the new bound — no parameter change required at the M-S5
   inner.

The audit should *also* assess:

- **The paper-grounded soundness map.** Verify
  `(lb, nq, pow_bits) → unconditional bits at Johnson radius`
  for our specific Plonky3-recursion FRI variant under
  `2025-2055.pdf` Theorem 1.5. Confirm γ < J(δ)−η at every
  M-S5 link (the paper's §8 attacks confirm beyond-Johnson is
  unsafe).
- **Knowledge soundness** (extractability) — not just
  computational soundness — for the consensus-facing artifact.
- **Pearl-byte-equivalence** of the mineable unit (the
  byte-equiv anchor for the SNARK).
- **No-forgery against the program pin** (CRIT-1: a prover
  cannot swap in a different program/AIR than the consensus-
  fixed one).

## 2. Threat model

### 2.1 Adversary classes

| Class | Capability | Why this audit assesses it |
|---|---|---|
| **A-FORGE** | Produces accepting `(proof, PI)` without a witness clearing real difficulty | Fund/PoW safety — the headline threat |
| **A-PROGRAM** | Forges by swapping the AIR / program / VK | CRIT-1: requires verifier-reconstructed canonical program (now first-class via Phase A-CR) |
| **A-NOISE** | Forges by supplying noised inputs that aren't the noise(committed plain) | §4.C.2 noise tie (A3.3 — zero-gap on 16∣r) |
| **A-SWAP** | Forges by swapping A or B matrix between strips, or skipping/duplicating stripes | §4.A fold-chain + M-S1 multiset bus |
| **A-TILE** | Wins a *cheaper* tile than attested | MED-3: verifier-derived `(tile_i, tile_j)` |
| **A-MAT** | Forges by supplying a different committed matrix than `HASH_A`/`HASH_B` | M52 matrix binding |
| **A-CHAIN** | Forges the recursion chain (claims a valid inner that isn't) | C2.4 in-circuit Tip5 Layer-0 verify + C3 ≥120-bit outer cert |
| **A-SOUND** | Exploits a sub-≥80-unconditional configuration | Every FRI tier in M-S5 is ≥ 80 unconditional under the `2025-2055.pdf` Theorem 1.5 Johnson-radius bound (LANDED `lb=2, nq=120` is well above 80 unconditional; §15 of C3 doc + §1.3 above) |
| **A-FRI** | Exploits a FRI commitment-scheme weakness | Standard Plonky3 FRI (audited upstream); we use established parameters; **proximity testing stays at γ < J(δ)−η** (Johnson radius, never beyond — `2025-2055.pdf` §8 attacks avoided) |
| **A-LDR** (new) | Pushes proximity testing beyond Johnson radius into the list-decoding regime where the paper's negative results + §8 attacks live | M-S5 chain audited to ensure no layer exceeds Johnson radius; M-S5b's S(−1) prerequisite (per the M-S5b design doc §3.0.A) will produce an explicit per-layer γ vs J(δ)−η table |
| **A-HASH** | Exploits Tip5 / BLAKE3 weakness | Tip5: KAT-anchored to spec (paper `2023-107.pdf`); BLAKE3: as-published |

### 2.2 What is **not** mitigated by this audit alone

- **Pearl-side weakness** of the vLLM extraction pipeline. The
  audit assesses ai-pow's byte-equivalence on a fixture; what
  Pearl actually mines (`B1` reference vectors, `B2` quant-
  extraction contract) is gated by Pearl's own audit.
- **Consensus integration security** (Phase D2 / `M-C1`). Out
  of scope.
- **FP8 layer security.** Not mined in this audit's scope.

## 3. Soundness-claim index — every claim, where argued, where tested

Read this as **the audit's main worktable.** Each row is:
`(claim → design doc with argument → test or KAT that
backs it → status)`.

### 4.3 Standing decoupling invariant (C1)

`Plonky3-recursion` is a **separate Cargo workspace, excluded
from ai-pow-zk**. Recursion crates **must not depend on
ai-pow-zk** (this is the C1 isolation invariant). Any future
C2.x extension that needs to know about Tip5 semantics must
edit the in-tree recursion crates directly (the hash is closed
Poseidon1/2-shaped, not generic — C2 already does this for
Tip5).

---

## 5. Tip5 AIR claims (the soundness linchpin)

### 5.1 What is being claimed (precise)

The Tip5 permutation AIR (`Plonky3-recursion/tip5-circuit-air/`)
implements a 7-round permutation **identical bit-for-bit** to
`nockchain_math::tip5::permute` over Goldilocks⁸, instantiated
per the Tip5 paper (ePrint `2023-107.pdf`) §4.3/§4.6.

Components:

| # | Component | Where | Verified by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **5.A** | Tip5 round constants (7-round) | `tip5-circuit-air/src/constants.rs` | byte-for-byte vs the paper's tabulation + `nockchain_math::tip5::permute` (KAT) |
| **5.B** | Per-byte cube `<p` canonical guard | `tip5-circuit-air/src/air.rs` § cube | algebraic identity machine-checked: `(x mod p)³ mod p == cube_table[x mod p]`; lookup-table arm enforces `0 ≤ x < p` |
| **5.C** | MDS matrix (Tip5 §4.5) | `tip5-circuit-air/src/mds.rs` | KAT vs paper + native |
| **5.D** | Lookup-table arm (LogUp degree-2) | `tip5-circuit-air/src/lookup.rs` + `circuit-prover/.../tip5/` | C2 L4 global-bus correctness (`8233a9e`); LogUp degree machine-proven 2 (not 226) |
| **5.E** | Round wiring (input → cube → MDS → next-round) | `tip5-circuit-air/src/air.rs` | per-row KAT |

### 5.2 Why no separate lookup-free path is required

§ 2b of `2026-05-18_C2_TIP5_CIRCUIT_AIR_DESIGN.md` originally
laid out a *lookup-free* algebraic arithmetization (per-byte
cube ≡ LOOKUP_TABLE via the C2.0 machine-proved identity + the
paper §4.6 canonical `<p` guard). § 2c then **corrected** that
the width was unacceptable for production and chose the
**lookup-table** arm. The lookup-free identity was **retained
as a machine-proved soundness argument** — it proves the
lookup-table arm is semantically the same constraint — but the
operational AIR is the lookup-table arm.

**Auditor note:** both arms reduce to the same algebraic
predicate; § 2b is the soundness anchor, § 2c is the
operational implementation. Auditing the lookup-table arm
suffices for both.

### 5.3 Native ↔ in-circuit equivalence

C2.1's KAT against `nockchain_math::tip5::permute` is the
**oracle**. The KAT iterates a published-large set of inputs
(deterministic + random) and asserts every Tip5 output column
matches bit-for-bit against the frozen native oracle. The
frozen oracle is the same code path consensus uses.

## 6. KAT / test-vector inventory (the auditor's reproducibility kit)

### 6.1 Tip5 KATs

| KAT | File | What it verifies |
|---|---|---|
| `tip5_air_kat_*` | `Plonky3-recursion/tip5-circuit-air/src/lib.rs` (test mod) | Tip5 7-round AIR per-row vs `nockchain_math::tip5::permute` |
| `test_tip5_lookups` | `Plonky3-recursion/recursion/tests/test_tip5_lookups.rs` | LogUp bus correctness |
| `test_tip5_layer0_recursion` | `Plonky3-recursion/recursion/tests/test_tip5_layer0_recursion.rs` | C2.4: in-circuit Tip5-L0 verifier accept + tamper-reject; 120-bit sweep |
| `test_tip5_layer0_compression` | `Plonky3-recursion/recursion/tests/test_tip5_layer0_compression.rs` | C3 / M-S5: ≥120-bit outer-recursive cert (Stage A/B/C, 5 sweep profiles, accept + tamper) |

### 6.2 ai-pow byte-equivalence KATs

| KAT | File | What it verifies |
|---|---|---|
| `pearl_compat_fixtures` | `crates/ai-pow/tests/pearl_compat_fixtures.rs` | Pearl-faithfulness fixtures (B0/B3) |
| `pearl_model_compat` | `crates/ai-pow/tests/pearl_model_compat.rs` | Real `Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-pearl` `gate_proj` INT7 weights byte-process |
| `quant` (4/4) | `crates/ai-pow/src/quant.rs` (#[cfg(test)]) | B2-contract bit-lossless |
| `b3_*` (3/3) | `crates/ai-pow/src/...` | BLAKE3 chip vs spec |

### 6.3 ai-pow-zk soundness KATs

| KAT | File | What it verifies |
|---|---|---|
| `crit1_*` | `crates/ai-pow-zk/src/.../crit1_tests.rs` (per the canonical-program design) | Any forged PROGRAM_COL ≠ canonical ⇒ reject |
| `high2_2_*` | `crates/ai-pow-zk/src/.../high2_2_tests.rs` | Honest matmul→fold→C4-hash chain; planted free `JACKPOT_MSG` ⇒ reject |
| §4.C.2 cx.0 KAT | per `2026-05-17_SEC_4C2_NOISE_BINDING_DESIGN.md` § 8 | Store row position-exact binds to committed bytes ∈ `HASH_A` |
| `end_to_end` | `crates/ai-pow --features zk` binary `end_to_end` | Full mining roundtrip incl. MED-3 |

### 6.4 Recursion regression slice

The always-run regression slice (from this session's
verification artifacts):

| Suite | Count | Time |
|---|---|---|
| `p3-recursion --test fibonacci_batch_stark_prover_quintic` | 1/0/0 | 0.07 s |
| `p3-recursion --test test_tip5_layer0_recursion` | 14/0/1 | 7.58 s |
| `p3-tip5-circuit-air` | 14/0/0 | 3.28 s |
| `c3_stage_a_l1_120bit_kat` + `c3_stage_b_l2_over_120bit_l1` | 2/0/0 | 96.84 s |

---

## 7. Adversarial-test inventory (what we reject)

The audit should reproduce these and add more. Each row
is `(attack class → test that already rejects it)`.

| Attack class | Concrete test | Source |
|---|---|---|
| A-PROGRAM (forge AIR/program) | `crit1_*` adversarial: any PROGRAM_COL ≠ canonical ⇒ reject | CR.6 + § 3.1 |
| A-NOISE (forge noised inputs) | `§4.C.2`/A3.2b store row ≠ `noise_ref(seed)` ⇒ reject | A3.2b commit `5a37c8e` |
| A-SWAP (swap A/B between strips) | adversarial swapped strip ⇒ reject (`HASH_A`/`HASH_B` mismatch) | M52 + P-B.2.2 |
| A-SWAP (skip/duplicate stripe) | adversarial skip/dup ⇒ reject via §6(b)/G2 | HIGH-2.2 § 6 |
| A-TILE (cheaper tile than attested) | opening off attested tile ⇒ reject pinned schedule | P-B.2.3 / A1 |
| A-MAT (forged committed matrix) | tampered `HASH_A` ≠ attested ⇒ reject | M52 |
| A-CHAIN (forge recursion) | tampered inner proof ⇒ `WitnessConflict` at `runner().run()` | C2.4 + C3 DT-4 tamper tests |
| A-SOUND (sub-120-bit configuration) | every M-S5 tier asserts `lb·nq/2 ≥ 120` | C3 § 15 |
| A-MAT (planted free `JACKPOT_MSG`) | `high2_*` adversarial ⇒ reject (M-S1) | HIGH-2.2 § 7 |
| A-FRI (tampered FRI fold) | `WitnessConflict` at the in-circuit FRI fold-chain `connect` | C3 DT-4 + § 15 |

---

## 8. Known residuals (explicit, no hidden gaps)

Honest list, R1-disciplined. Anything the audit might
otherwise be "surprised" by is here.

| Residual | What it is | Where tracked |
|---|---|---|
| **M-S5b / `#131`** | ≤65 KB terminal compression of the ≥120-bit M-S5 cert (size target only; soundness unaffected — the ≥120-bit cert is LANDED) | `2026-05-19_M_S5B_TERMINAL_COMPRESSION_DESIGN.md` |
| **Phase B1** | Pearl **reference vectors** from Pearl's miner (golden `(κ,s_a,s_b,E/F,one tile digest)`); today only self-consistency vs ai-pow's own plain path is tested | `2026-05-18_PHASE_B_DESIGN.md` § B1; `2026-05-13_PEARL_COMPARISON.md` |
| **Phase B2** | Quant-extraction contract: specify how the vLLM plugin maps the model's INT7/INT8 GEMM operands to Pearl type-0 `[−64,64]` int8 `(A,B,μ)`; integration KAT against a real model fixture | `2026-05-18_PHASE_B_DESIGN.md` § B2 |
| **Packed-MMCS `GoldilocksConfig`** | Landed config is unpacked; `verify_p3_batch_proof_circuit` requires packed; aarch64-neon `Goldilocks::Packing ≠ Goldilocks`. Verified-soundness-neutral substitute used in measurement; production L2 needs the upstream fix or a packed-MMCS sibling. | `2026-05-19_C3_OUTER_CERT_DESIGN.md` § 14 |
| **R-b** (M12 / `#127`) | ai-pow-zk's actual M10.1c composite `RecursiveAir` vs the representative `FibonacciAir` in the recursion harness | `2026-05-14_M10_1C_DESIGN.md`; M12 task |
| **G3** carry-vector segmentation | Deferred — this model is in `k ≤ 2¹⁶` Pearl envelope; revive only if a workload exceeds the envelope | `2026-05-17_M_S2_G3AB_DESIGN.md` |
| **FP8 PoUW** | Pearl's FP protocol unshipped; INT-only production scope (documented limitation, not a defect) | `2026-05-17_PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md` § 0 |
| **D1 / D2** | vLLM miner-plugin + consensus block-cert integration — external | roadmap Phase D |

### 8.1 Non-residuals (claims a careless audit might list — preempted here)

- "C3 incomplete" — C3 is the soundness-correct ≥120-bit cert,
  LANDED + independently re-validated. The ≤65 KB *size* target
  is a **separate carved-out milestone (M-S5b)**. This is not
  hidden C3 incompleteness. See § 8 of
  `2026-05-19_C3_OUTER_CERT_DESIGN.md`.
- "§4.C.2 has a gap" — production is always `16 ∣ r` (Pearl
  §4.8); the production path is **zero-gap**. The non-16∣r
  TEST geometry is A3.2b documented strictly-stronger-than-
  pre-A3 — not a forgery hole. Memory + § 8 of the §4.C.2
  design doc.
- "CRIT-1 is `extract`-of-reference" — that was the *old* model;
  Phase A-CR (CR.0–CR.7) flipped the verify path to a
  witness-free params-pure `canonical_program(params, block_public)`.

## 9. Out-of-scope notes (for the auditor's record)

| Item | Why out of scope | Where to look later |
|---|---|---|
| Pearl's vLLM plugin code | Owned by Pearl, audited separately | Pearl whitepaper §5; Pearl repo |
| FP8 layer security | Pearl FP PoUW unshipped | wait for Pearl FP spec |
| Phase D (consensus integration) | External wiring; not ai-pow-zk's stack | `2026-05-17_PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md` Phase D |
| Trusted-setup ceremony (if Path A SNARK chosen for M-S5b) | Out of this audit; that's the M-S5b follow-on audit | `2026-05-19_M_S5B_TERMINAL_COMPRESSION_DESIGN.md` § 2.A |
| Nockchain consensus layer | Out of scope for this proof-system audit | Nockchain consensus docs |

## 10. Audit-readiness checklist

Before the auditor begins, confirm:

- [x] **Soundness-claim index complete** (§ 3 above — every
      CRIT/HIGH/MAT/A3/C/ENV claim has a design doc and a test).
- [x] **Recursion stack inventoried** (§ 4).
- [x] **Tip5 AIR claims separately laid out** (§ 5 — the
      linchpin).
- [x] **KAT / test inventory documented** (§ 6).
- [x] **Adversarial tests catalogued** (§ 7).
- [x] **Residuals explicitly listed** (§ 8; no hidden gaps).
- [x] **Out-of-scope explicitly listed** (§ 1.2, § 9).
- [x] **Threat model documented** (§ 2).
- [x] **Standing R1 discipline declared** (no rushing; staged
      validated commits; precise residuals — `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
      R1/R1.1).
- [x] **Soundness bar paper-grounded** (≥80 unconditional under
      `2025-2055.pdf` Theorem 1.5 Johnson-radius bound; §1.3).
- [ ] **Per-layer `γ < J(δ)−η` table produced** (M-S5b's S(−1)
      prerequisite — `2026-05-19_M_S5B_TERMINAL_COMPRESSION_DESIGN.md`
      §3.0.A; not a blocker for the audit to *begin* but
      should land before any new layer is added).
- [ ] **Pearl B1 reference vectors obtained** (B1 still open;
      this is a known residual not a blocker for starting the
      audit — the auditor can begin on the in-scope items and
      revisit B1 when the reference vectors arrive).
- [ ] **Packed-MMCS `GoldilocksConfig` substrate decision**
      recorded (either upstream patch or sibling config, per
      § 8 above).
- [ ] **M-S5b path decision recorded** (S3 in
      `2026-05-19_M_S5B_TERMINAL_COMPRESSION_DESIGN.md`); not a
      blocker for the C4 audit (M-S5b lands in a follow-on
      audit round if Path A/C is chosen; Path B alone keeps it
      in this audit round).

The three open items are honest residuals, not blockers. The
audit can begin on the in-scope items as listed.

## 12. Definition of done — when C4 / M-S6 is closed

This package is "ready for audit." **C4 / M-S6 closes when**
the external audit report is delivered and:

1. The auditor's findings have been triaged.
2. Any new soundness gaps are tracked in
   `2026-05-15_GAP_AUDIT.md` with the same R1 discipline
   (validated subset + precise residual per finding).
3. The "experimental / unaudited" gate is removed from the
   recursion stack per the roadmap exit gate.

Until the external report exists and items 1–3 are honest, C4
is **in progress**. This document being committed flips
`#125` from `pending` to `in_progress` (audit readiness stage),
not `completed`.
