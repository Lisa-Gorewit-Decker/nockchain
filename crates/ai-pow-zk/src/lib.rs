//! Plonky3 SNARK circuit for the `ai-pow` tiling matmul puzzle.
//!
//! Mirrors Pearl's `zk-pow` role at the proof-certificate layer: where Pearl
//! uses a compact proof to certify the opened useful-work statement, this
//! crate uses Plonky3 over Goldilocks + Tip5 + FRI plus recursion to build
//! Nockchain's canonical recursive AI-PoW certificate. The plain
//! `MatmulProof` remains a miner-side diagnostic/pre-ZKP target-hit check,
//! not the persisted block artifact.
//!
//! ## Attempt Reuse Boundary
//!
//! Production AI-PoW is intentionally minimal-reuse across nonce attempts.
//! Changing the NCMN nonce must force fresh transcript-derived commitments,
//! noise, noised matrix strips, tile states, jackpot preimages, and proof
//! witness data. Cache-friendly reuse of those values is a consensus
//! vulnerability for this puzzle, not an optimization target.
//!
//! ## Public API
//!
//! - [`recursion::prove_canonical_ai_pow_certificate`] — the canonical
//!   recursive wrapper for Nockchain's AI-PoW certificate. It proves
//!   the Layer-0 composite STARK, recursively verifies that proof in
//!   an L1 circuit, and returns the recursive certificate. This is the
//!   only proof object intended for Nockchain consensus, block
//!   persistence, or wire transmission; consensus code must still
//!   verify that the bound Layer-0 public statement is the intended
//!   full-matmul work unit.
//! - [`composite_proof::composite_prove_pinned_logup`] /
//!   [`composite_proof::composite_verify_pinned_logup`] — Layer-0
//!   composite STARK primitives. These are intermediate inputs to the
//!   recursive certificate and are not persisted proof artifacts by
//!   themselves.
//! - [`composite_proof::composite_prove`] / [`composite_proof::composite_verify`]
//!   — dev-only unpinned prove + verify pair, wrapping `p3-uni-stark`.
//! - [`composite_full_air::CompositeFullAir`] — the top-level AIR over
//!   `TOTAL_TRACE_WIDTH` columns. 10 chips share every row, gated by
//!   selector bits packed into `CONTROL_PREP`.
//! - [`composite_full_air_with_lookups::CompositeFullAirWithLookups`] —
//!   same AIR with 7 LogUp buses reified via `p3-batch-stark`. Used
//!   when full cross-chip soundness is required.
//! - [`composite_trace::CompositeTrace`] — trace generator with
//!   `place_*` helpers for each instruction type (matmul step, BLAKE3
//!   hash, jackpot rotation).
//! - [`composite_public::CompositePublicInputs`] — typed 20-element PI
//!   vector (4 i32 cumsum + 16 u32 jackpot) bound by the AIR on the
//!   trace's last row.
//! - [`params::ZkParams`] — circuit parameter shape (rows / cols of the
//!   matmul puzzle).
//! - [`circuit::AiPowStarkConfig`] / [`circuit::CircuitConfig`] — the
//!   STARK config factory (Goldilocks + Tip5 + FRI parameters per
//!   profile).
//!
//! ## Architectural note
//!
//! `ai-pow-zk` is intentionally **standalone** — it does **not** depend
//! on `ai-pow`. The proving crate (`ai-pow`) is the consumer; making
//! `ai-pow-zk` depend back on it would introduce a circular workspace
//! dep. The caller in `ai-pow` constructs [`ZkParams`] and the trace +
//! PIs from its own types at the call site.
//!
//! ## Status
//!
//! M10.1c is the Layer-0 composite pipeline. The production
//! Nockchain certificate is the recursive L1 certificate produced by
//! the `recursion` module, not the raw Layer-0 proof. Earlier M9.1 /
//! M10.1b prototypes were retired once M10.1c had full LogUp + PI
//! binding + bench data.
//! See `2026-05-14_ENGINEERING_REPORT.md` for the architectural review and bench
//! numbers; `2026-05-14_M10_1C_PROGRESS.md` for the phase-by-phase history.
//!
//! ## What's not yet bound
//!
//! - **`h_a` / `h_b` matrix bindings** (task #52). The witness's
//!   `a_rows` / `b_cols` aren't yet tied to chain-pinned chunk-Merkle
//!   roots. Multi-week deferred work.
//! - **Full-matmul recursive statement.** The current recursive certificate
//!   verifies one selected tile. Production block admission therefore fails
//!   closed for multi-tile params until the recursive statement binds a
//!   full-matmul aggregate or equivalent full-work certificate.
//! - **Hoon noun verifier hook.** The structured recursive-certificate noun
//!   encoder exists in the miner crate, but consensus still needs the jet /
//!   wiring that decodes the noun at the block boundary, reconstructs the
//!   verifier-derived statement from block data, and calls the Rust verifier.
//!   Until that hook is wired, the Hoon/kernel path remains fail-closed.
